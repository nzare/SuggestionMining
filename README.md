# SuggestionMining
Suggestion mining can be defined as the extraction of suggestions from unstructured text, where the term 'suggestions' 
refers to the expressions of tips, advice, recommendations etc. The opinions of customers are largely positive and negative sentiments 
towards a given entity and also tend to contain suggestions for improvising the entity or tips to the fellow consumers. 
This is a binary text classification model using BERT.
